[h1]Description[/h1]
This mod enhances block renaming in Space Engineers by adding advanced controls to thrusters and other blocks, allowing you to rename multiple blocks at once with ease. Inspired by two excellent simple renaming mods:

[/list]
My version builds on these ideas with new features like directional thruster renaming, group-based numbering, and a centralized numbering logic tailored for organizing complex builds.

[h1]Changelog & Fixes[/h1]
[b]v1.5.11 - Latest Update[/b]
[list]
[*] [b]NEW:[/b] Number Separator now allows empty strings. You can now use sequential numbering without any spaces (e.g., [b]Battery01[/b]) by leaving the separator field empty.

[h1]Important: Terminal Input Limitations[/h1]
[b]Note for non-US Keyboard users (e.g., Croatian, German, etc.):[/b]
The Space Engineers terminal [b]does not allow[/b] the input of characters that require the [b]AltGr[/b] key combination.
[list]
[*] Characters like [b] \ | [ ] { } < > [/b] cannot be typed directly into the mod's textboxes if your layout requires AltGr (e.g., [b]AltGr + Q[/b] for backslash).
[*] [b]Workaround:[/b] If you need these characters for Regex patterns, type them in Notepad and use [b]Ctrl+V[/b] to paste them into the game's textbox.
[/list]

[h1]Regex Renaming Guide[/h1]
Regex (Regular Expressions) is a powerful way to bulk-replace parts of names using patterns. The mod uses [b]C# .NET syntax[/b].
[list]
[*] [b]Wildcards:[/b] [b].[/b] (any single char), [b].[/b] (everything)
[*] [b]Groups:[/b] Use b[/b] to capture parts of the name, and [b]$1, $2, $3[/b] to replace them.
[*] [b]No quotes needed:[/b] Just enter the pattern directly into the textboxes.
